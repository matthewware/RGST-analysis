# RGST-analysis environment

Code for analyzing and plotting GST data from [arxiv:1803.01818](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.01818).

## Docker
The `Docker/` folder contains a `Dockerfile` and instructions for building the analysis environment used in the tomographic reconstruction, analysis, and plotting of data in the `data/` folder. It is highly recommended that this image be used to run the analysis -- all the code was originally written in 2016-2017 and depends on rather outdated version of Python and Julia, as well as the assorted libraries used, and the image downloads all the appropriate versions. Building the image will take ~10 minutes depending on your machine and internet connection.

Note that the pygsti reconstruction can be very resource intensive! It can take ~2hrs when run serially on an 8 core machine (this corresponds to performing 14 different pygsti reconstructions). You can skip this step and go straight to plotting/playing with the operators using the supplied `*.npz` files containing the LGST results. There are more details in the analysis notebooks.

If you _would_ like to
do the full analysis, we recommend you make sure your Docker is configured to
use a significant amount of RAM (i.e. as much as you can offer. The default value on Mac OSx is 2 GB for example). Data files in
the `data/` directory were reconstructed using roughly 6 GB of RAM.

Once the docker image is built the `start_env.sh`, `stop_env.sh`, and
`copy_data.sh` utility scripts can be used to manage the environment.

### Binder
The top-level Dockerfile is for the [binder.org](https://mybinder.org/) build. This can be launched from the badge above. The binder build will also, most likely, take a long time. This could depend on how much is cached on the binder side. The limited resources on the binder.org side will also make the notebook a bit slow but it should work. The generation of the Hessian-based error bars for the diamond distance will be particularly slow.

It is highly recommended that you not redo the `pygst` analysis on binder.org. This is the most time and resource intensive process and is already done for you with the results saved in `.npz` files. See the analysis notebook for more details.

## Analysis notebooks
  * The `Randomize.ipynb` notebook walks through the process of generating randomized GST experiments based on sequences generated by pyGSTi.
  * The `RGST-analysis.ipynb` contains all the code for analyzing the experimental data (after it has been collated into the format necessary for pyGSTi to run), as well as generating plots and error bars.
